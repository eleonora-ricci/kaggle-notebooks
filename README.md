# kaggle-notebooks

Syncing some of my public notebooks for various practice competitions on Kaggle:

- *ps3e14-berrylicious-predictions-with-pytorch.ipynb*: detailedly documented neural network implementation using PyTorch and FLAML hypertuning. Applied to the Wild Blueberry Yield Dataset for the episode 14 of season 3 of the playground competitions series.

- *spell-check-on-tick-labels-using-bert.ipynb*: step-by-step walkthrough on the use of a pretrained language model (BERT) to spell-check the predicted plot axis labels in the context of the Benetech Making Graphs Accessible competition.

- *learning-pipelines-productivity-reusability.ipynb*: step-by-step walkthrough of the application of sklearn pipelines to create a general and reusable preprocessing workflow with pandas. Applied to the Titanic beginners competition dataset.
